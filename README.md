-------------------WHAT THIS IS-------------------

This is my CSC 102 Final Project for the course.
We were tasked with creating a worldle program.
There are Debug controls in the top left to set your own word to test and see if the program functions properly.

-------------------IMPROVEMENTS FOR NEXT TIME-------------------

I would break out the classes into seperate files.
I would also take a look at the Coloring logic to see if I couldn't improve it.
Adding in the funtionality to have a dynamic word size could be possible. Also not too difficult to achieve given the GUI generation is entirely created in code, not through the form editor in VS.
Getting the program to interact with a database of words online may be helpful for expanding the word sizes that could be used, as well as adding more words to the options.
  If this is done, removing the check to see if the word was already picked should be removed to allow for easier integration with said database. It would also be somewhat usless especially if the system has 4-5 thousand 4-letter words alone. If it was dynamic word sizes, it would be even larger.
Adding in better score retention through encrypted text doc may be a good idea for user experience.
